Notes from my learning on Python 3.x

This is a test to check if still can commit and push a file from the top of my mind, let´s see how it goes.

List
- Mutable
- Uses []
- Permitted operations
  = append
  = pop
  = remove

Tuples
- Unmutable
- Uses ()
- Indivual elements can´t be removed, instead the tuple must be deleted

Set
- Unique values only
- Permitted operations
    = Union
    = Intersection
- Uses {}
- Has a constructor set()

I´ll have to review my other notes to confirm that what I added here is accurated :/
